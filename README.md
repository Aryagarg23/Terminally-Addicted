# Terminally-Addicted 🖥️🎶🎮💬

Welcome to **Terminally-Addicted**, the project where everything happens in the terminal—because why should you ever leave the beautiful, cozy, blinking cursor life? From playing your favorite Spotify tracks to managing your GitHub issues and even chatting with a GPT-powered bot, everything is packed inside your good ol’ terminal. No JavaScript, no flashy interfaces—just pure, unadulterated terminal goodness. 

You never have to leave. No, really... you don’t. Trust us.

## Features 🚀
- **Spotify Integration**: Use `/sp` commands to jam out without ever leaving the terminal. Play, pause, skip tracks, or jump straight to your favorite songs. Who needs a GUI, right?
- **GitHub Issue Manager**: `/git` lets you manage your repos, open issues, comment, and close them like a terminal ninja. 
- **Todoist Task Manager**: `/todo` helps you manage your ever-growing task list without getting distracted by any... oh look, a cute dog video!
- **GPT Chatbot**: `/chat` to have deep, meaningful conversations with a GPT-powered bot. Or just argue about the best pizza topping.
- **YouTube Video Viewer**: `/yt` streams videos right in your terminal using ASCII art. Enjoy your low-res content in maximum geeky fashion.
- **Environment Manager**: `/set env` to tweak your settings on the fly. Vim’s still king around here. 

### Bonus:
The terminal is your universe—stay here, live here, get stuff done, or simply procrastinate with ASCII art. We’re not judging.

## Installation ⚙️
Make sure you have the required dependencies, including `curses`, `subprocess`, `Spotify API`, `Todoist API`, `GitHub API`, and your very own GPT integration.

Then, just clone this bad boy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Terminally-Addicted.git
cd Terminally-Addicted
```

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️
Fire up the main script with:

```bash
python main.py
```

The terminal will now become your best (and only) friend. It’s like living in *The Matrix*, but with fewer phone booths and more ASCII.

## Command Guide 📝

### Spotify Commands
- `/sp -cs <song_name>`: Change to a specific song.
- `/sp -next`: Skip to the next track like you’re a DJ with commitment issues.
- `/sp -prev`: Relive the past by playing the previous track.
- `/sp -ps`: Pause the music when your boss walks by.
- `/sp -pl`: Play your music again after they leave.

### Chatbot Commands
- `/chat -s`: Short, witty responses from our bot friend.
- `/chat -l`: Long, existential rants. You know, the deep stuff.
- `/chat -l -cls`: Chat with a fresh start (no history), because sometimes we all want a clean slate.

### GitHub Issue Commands
- `/git create <title> --body=Your issue description --labels=bug,urgent`: Create a new issue because who doesn’t love adding problems to GitHub?
- `/git close <issue_number>`: Close issues like a productivity overlord.
- `/git comment <issue_number> "This is a comment"`: Drop some wisdom (or memes) on an issue.
- `/git list --state=open`: List all open issues. Who needs to scroll through a browser when you can do it in your terminal?
- `/git set repo owner/repo_name`: Set your repository for ultimate coding domination.

### Todoist Commands
- `/todo list`: List your tasks, because staying organized is cool now.
- `/todo add <task>`: Add a task to remind yourself to not forget your other tasks.
- `/todo list -more`: Show even more tasks! (assuming you haven’t drowned in them yet)

### YouTube Viewer
- `/yt <video_url>`: Watch videos... in ASCII form. Because who needs HD anyway?

## Shell Name? Suggestions Needed! 💡
We still need a catchy name for our shell. Help us out by suggesting something equally ridiculous and awesome. Current contenders:
- `AddictShell`
- `TermFix`
- `ShellShock`
- `InShellity`
- `TermiKnight`

Feel free to suggest your own crazy names! (Please, we need help).

## Known Bugs 🐞
- **Spotify skips backwards through time occasionally.** We think it’s a feature.
- **GitHub bot is too polite.** We’re working on making it sassier.
- **Todoist makes you question life choices.** Unfixable.
- **ASCII YouTube may cause temporary blindness.** Proceed with caution.
