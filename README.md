# Terminally-Addicted 🖥️🎶🎮💬

## Welcome to **Terminally-Addicted**, the project where everything happens in the terminal—and VIM. Because why should you ever leave the beautiful, cozy, blinking cursor life? From playing your favorite Spotify tracks 🎧 to managing your GitHub issues 🐙, chatting with a GPT-powered bot 🤖, and organizing your life with Todoist 📝, everything is packed inside your good ol’ terminal and beloved VIM editor. No JavaScript, no flashy interfaces—just pure, unadulterated terminal and VIM goodness.


# **_You never have to leave. No, really... you don’t. Trust us. 🌀_**


## Features 🚀

- 🎵 **Spotify Integration** : Use `/sp` commands to control your jams without ever leaving the terminal. Play, pause, skip tracks, or jump to your favorite song like a true command-line DJ. 🎶
- 🐙 **GitHub Issue Manager** : `/git` lets you manage your repos, create, close, and comment on issues—all from within the terminal. GitHub? More like GitGood! 💻
- 📋 **Todoist Task Manager** : `/todo` helps you stay productive with your ever-growing task list. Add tasks, list them, or avoid them entirely while browsing ASCII art. We don't judge. 😉
- 🤖 **GPT Chatbot** : `/chat` to have those deep, philosophical convos with a bot. Or just get it to tell you a joke. We got range. 💬
- 📺 **YouTube Video Viewer** : `/yt` lets you watch videos in your terminal, because who needs high-def videos when you can have **ASCII art**?! 🎥🤓
- 🔧 **Environment Manager** : `/set env` to tweak your environment on the fly. And yes, you’ll be editing it with Vim. Terminal nerds, rejoice! 🚀

### Bonus:
The terminal is now your universe—live in it, breathe it, and never leave it. It’s like *The Matrix*... but with fewer phone booths and more curses (pun intended). 😜

## Installation ⚙️
Make sure you have all the required dependencies, including `curses`, `subprocess`, Spotify API, Todoist API, GitHub API, and GPT integration.

Then, just clone this bad boy:

```

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️
Fire up the terminal of your dreams with:

```bash

**Pro tip**: If your terminal crashes from awesomeness, that's normal. Just reboot and try again. 😎
